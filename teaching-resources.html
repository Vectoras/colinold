            <h3>Why Me</h3>

            <p>
              Over the past 35+ years of my teaching career, I have generated countless resources in all areas of English teaching, especially English Literature. I have a deep love for poetry and how
              to make it accessible to young people. My Masters dissertation concerned how boys react to poetry, and included classwork activities which would promote confidence and enjoyment of this
              medium. I am keen to share my ideas of teaching in the classroom with others, with activities which I have found highly successful. I offer my experience at a minimal one-time payment,
              but as I continue to build my resource bank electronically, you will be given access. I still teach part-time, so this will be on-going!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you scroll down on this page, you will see examples of how my resources will be accessed. Folders appear with generic titles covering English areas, such as Grammar Basics, Poetry
              Notes or Shakespeare. Within these, are drop-down icons providing ideas for more specific texts or lessons. After you make your one-time payment, feel free to edit the resources as
              appropriate.
