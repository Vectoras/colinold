            <h3>Why Me</h3>
            <p>
              Over the past 32 years, I have privately tutored all manner of students, including both school pupils and adults. I had only ever anticipated tutoring children of school age for SATs
              exams (11 and 14-year-olds), GCSEs (16-year- olds) and entrance exams for private schools. However, after tutoring a man in the navy who needed an English qualification, and coaching a
              Spanish final year student for her re-takes, I decided to make myself available for adults as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am happy to travel to local destinations and my hourly fee is very reasonable when compared to what other tutors or tuition centres are charging. Tutoring in a more relaxed
              environment, in familiar surroundings over a cup of coffee, is often more preferable to the usual more formal, impersonal setting of a school or college.

            I would then arrange an initial meeting gratis, to establish your specific requirements and work alongside you to organise a programme of study. At the same time, I would explain the
            hourly and half-hourly fee which is determined by the examination level being studied.
