          <p>
            For several years, the Rotary Club of Chichester and District had run a poetry competition but my school had never taken part. With my love of poetry, I decided to enter a number of pupils
            from my lunch-time poetry club. We were up against several other schools, including private schools, and pupils who were home-tutored. For five consecutive years, my pupils procured not
            only recommendations but top prizes and the resulting financial benefits.

            Matt was a keen student but found English a difficult subject. Being a keen member of the Cadet Force in his Chichester school, he dreamt of joining the RAF. However, he needed a C-grade
            for English Language, but was only predicted a D. After 2 months of tuition, not only did he pass, but he exceeded all expectations and gained a B. He is currently training with the RAF.

            Veronika and Ondrej were immigrants from the Czech Republic who took on school cleaning jobs in my Southampton school earlier this millennium. They were so friendly and really keen to
            improve their English. One day, they asked me if I could help them gain GCSEs in English because they wanted to secure some British qualifications before they returned to their native
            country. I willingly offered and they faithfully arrived every Sunday afternoon for several months. Both of them gained C-grades having never taken exams before.

            This brother and sister went to a Fareham school but lacked confidence. The older brother, Stephen, shied away from reading but after I made his teaching fun, not only did he gain an
            A-grade in both English exams, but went on to study A-level in a local 6 th -form college. Kerry, his younger sister, also gained top GCSE English grades and has since gained a degree in
            Nursing

              pronounce every word I found difficult. Due to my fluent and confident use of English, people were surprised to know that I have been in this country for one year only."
